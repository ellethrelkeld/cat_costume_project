            <h3>About Kat</h3>
                  <p>Kat is the ultimate cat lady you've always dreamed you could
                  be. Never has a Halloween gone by where her twelve cats weren't
                  all dressed to impress. Five years ago, she decided to open
                  Kat's Costume Shop to share her passion with the world.</p>

                  <h3>About Mavis</h3>
                  <p>Mavis has been designing custom clothes for her three
                  cats since she was fifteen years old. She loves working on
                  custom orders. Her cats are often roaming freely throughout
                  the store and modeling the latest trends.</p>
